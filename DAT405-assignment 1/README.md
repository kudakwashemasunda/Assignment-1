DAT405: generative art
============================


Description:
------------
This assignment made me look for inspiration from many artist but there was a concept that mainly had my attention. The concept known as the motion after-effect illusion.  It is a concept that is said that if you look at a waterfall for about 20 seconds, when you look at a stationary object, the object will just look as if it’s moving in the opposite direction. This happens because the visual illusion that you experience after viewing this moving stimulus is an after effect/response that your stimuli make which will be really slow in reaction time. A few artists have looked at this illusionary effect and of them being Aristotle. Another artist that motivated me was the one who made a website called silk (http://weavesilk.com/), its uses lines that mirror themselves making a really good generative art from it.


During the development process, I had to mainly depend on trials so that I would be able to have more ideas to add to make art. At the beginning, my initial idea was to just make shapes will be spiralling but eventually some of them didn’t go well with the effect i.e. circles, they didn’t end up giving the whole spiralling effect after. I used an array so that it is possible to rotate between different specified colours. I made the mouse movement across the X axis change the angle that the squares move in to provide a live and fast effect of the shapes moving even more or less. Clicking clears the sketch so the user can regenerate the same sketch. Refreshing the page also generates a new image entirely as the square sizes are generated randomly.


I used a lot of the references and examples provided on the p5js.org website to help me when I got stuck during the development as well as to provide me with ideas for user inputs as I did not think of all of them before I had started the project. Quick searches using stack overflow also helped me resolve any issues with logic very quickly from seeing other people finding solutions to the same problems. In order to improve my work I would provide further methods of input, such as another effect when the mouse moves on the Y axis and things such as sliders on the website. Just to make the generative work not look bare, I used CSS to just add some instructions to the page also a header and a footer to the page.



how to use:
------------
- Press the left and right arrow keys to change the colour.
- Move mouse on X axis to change angle.
- Click to clear.
- Refresh to regenerate.
